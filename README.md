A RESTful Web API using **Express.js** that operates a private Blockchain. It registers users with stars using Bitcoin wallet.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- NPM (This should be installed already when you install Node.js)
- Bitcoin Wallet (eg. Electrum) (The code could run perfectly without it, but you must have that to test the code.)
